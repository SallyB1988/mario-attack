# mario-attack

Each character has a random number of **health points**, **attack points** and **attack increase** points. When two players battle, they lower their opponents health points by their attack points value. The attack points of the character fighting for you then has his attack points incremented by their attack increase value. (The opponent's attack points value remains the same.)

## Playing the game
Choose a character to fight for you. You must defeat 3 opponents to win the game. If your health points drop below zero, you lose.
